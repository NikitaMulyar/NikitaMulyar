## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am Nikita, I am 17 years old, I am from Moscow, Russia.
- ðŸ”­ **EDUCATION:** I am interested in industrial development as well as Olympiad programming. Now I am in the 11th grade of the Lyceum "Second School" named after V. F. Ovchinnikov. A year ago, I graduated from the two-year program of the Lyceum of the Yandex Academy "Python Development" with honors.
- ðŸ’» **PROJECTS:** In my git you can find 3 educational projects from the 2nd year of study. I am also a co-author with my classmate of the telegram bot "L2SH Schedule", which has been introduced into the educational process of my Lyceum since March 2024. It now has about 750 users. At the moment, the source code repository is hidden because we are in the process of filing a patent for our development. In addition to this project, a website for admission to the Lyceum is currently under development. The repository of this project is also hidden, we will open it soon (in the fall of 2024).
